    <p>
    I've been studying functional programming for many years, having presented a
    lecture about Haskell back in early 2015, and whenever possible I assimilate
    functional concepts into my coding style and advocate its benefits to
    co-workers. However, I was never in a position where I could use a
    fully-featured FP language for a product. Therefore, one of my main goals for
    the near future is working on a project that has a FP language in its stack.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm also interested in education, machine learning, virtual reality, compilers
    and game development.
    </p>

    <p>
    I appreciate a relaxed environment, preferably small companies and startups, in
    which all team members are compromised with the success of the project.
    </p>

    <p>
    I don't care for needless worries and wasting time on meetings without
    actionable outcomes.
