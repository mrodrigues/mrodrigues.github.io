    Due to my academic background and years of product development leading Scrum
    teams and acting as CTO in small startups, I have been exposed to a broad
    collection of domains. While deeply specialized in software engineering, I'm
    also able to write more advanced algorithms. I'm particularly proud of my
    debugging skills, strongly influenced by the scientific method.
