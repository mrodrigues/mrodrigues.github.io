Today it finally starts: my first day without a boss. For the last two months
I've been both excited and afraid of this day, but it has slowly approached
without any regards to my mundane worries.

I've had many different jobs, including as a freelancer once when I was still
living with my parents, and for some time now I've been taking some freelance
projects and mentoring people on [Codementor](http://codementor.io/mrodrigues),
but this is the first time since I started paying the so feared bills I won't
have a guaranteed income at the end of the month. And that's scary as hell.
It's also thrilling: I'll be able to work according to my own demand, I'll have
much more opportunities to make money, I'll work on several different projects
and, more importantly, learn a lot of stuff.

This is also a great opportunity to deal with what, for lack of a better name,
I'll call life debt, which I've accumulated during my college years. This life
debt, differently from the literal sense, represents the time I've borrowed
from my own life so I'd be able to study and pass the tests, the things I've
promised myself I'd do one day, be it going back to the gym, reading some books
or learning linear algebra.

For this reason, I'll state publicly here the compromises I'm make with myself.
During this time as a freelancer programmer, I'll:

* Build a game complete game. Not a simple prototype built in a game jam, a
  complex and polished, production-ready game. Preferably a 3D game using
  [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), which leads to...
* Linear algebra and analytic geometry the *right way*. I simply couldn't make
  any use of what I "learned" during the college, and building 3D games it's
  the perfect way to fix those knowledges.
* Build a mobile project, probably using some hybrid framework like
  [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/).
* Build a project using functional programming. Not simply how to use
  functional techniques in my current stack, but build something from scratch
  using a purely functional language like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) or
  [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).
* Build something cool with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) or [Raspberry
  Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
* Learn advanced vim commands, as well as improve my workflow in many ways.
* Implement the [GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)
  method efficiently. I've tried before, but just couldn't get it right.
* Go back to eating healthy and exercising. My goal isn't simply
  professional, I want a happy and fulfilling life, so I need to improve it as
  a whole.
* Get my home organised. It may be overlooked, but often programmers have
  difficulty maintaining even their own rooms tidy. Those distractions
  simply get in your way, stressing you out, gradually.
* Work while traveling at least once.
* Catch up with my entertainment backlog: books, videogames, movies and series.
  I cannot afford another year running away from spoilers.
* Get non-technical hobbies, like going back to playing guitar or training kung-fu.
* Last but not least, meet my friends more frequently and have an overall
  healthy social life.

Finally, I'll use this blog to both keep motivated and to share my personal
experiences, which might be valuable to others. I'll also give advice on
how to overcome the obstacles I find along the way. I'll review equipments,
tools, techniques, as well as share tips for how to succeed where I succeeded,
and what to avoid where I failed. I'll try to write at least weekly, so this
becomes part of my routine. I expect you find these readings pleasurable and
informative, so if I fail at that, give me a heads up!

I hope you follow me on this new journey!
