30 years, married, living in Yokohama, Japan.

## Current position

CTO at oduk.k.k., exploring the startup scene in Japan.

## What I'm looking for

I've been studying functional programming for many years, having presented a
lecture about Haskell back in early 2015, and whenever possible I assimilate
functional concepts into my coding style and advocate its benefits to
co-workers. However, I was never in a position where I could use a
fully-featured FP language for a product. Therefore, one of my main goals for
the near future is working in a product that has a FP language in its stack.

I'm also interested in education, machine learning, virtual reality, compilers
and game development.

I appreciate a relaxed environment, preferably small companies and startups, in
which all team members are compromised with the success of the project.

I don't appreciate needless worries and wasting time on meetings without
actionable outcomes.

## Specialized in

- Building products for early stage startups using the Lean methodology
- Providing consulting on technology choices
- Teaching and mentoring juniors
- Ensuring a high-quality codebase

## Skills

Due to my academic background and years of product development leading Scrum
teams and acting as CTO in small startups, I have been exposed to a broad
collection of domains. While deeply specialized in software engineering, I'm also
able to write more advanced algorithms. I'm particularly proud of my debugging skills,
strongly influenced by the scientific method.
